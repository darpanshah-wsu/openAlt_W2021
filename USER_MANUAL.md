# User Manual
This document details how to get set-up if you would like to clone the repository and run the web server yourself.  

## 1. Install the Dependencies
### 1.1 Windows
  * Install [Python 3.8.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and add it to your PATH.
  * Install MySQL using the [Windows Installer](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/). Be sure to install the Python connector and workbench.
  * Use pip to install the needed Python modules. This command will install them all at once:    
    `pip install schedule crossrefapi flask virtualenv python-dateutil flask-paginate pytz`
  * Install version 4.4 or higher of MongoDB community edition by by following the instructions in this [link](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/). 
### 1.2 Ubuntu
  * Install Python 3:  
  `sudo apt install Python3`
  * Python for Windows includes pip3 but on Ubuntu we need to install it with:  
  `sudo apt install python3-pip`
  * Install the first set of needed Python modules:  
  `pip3 install schedule crossrefapi flask virtualenv python-dateutil flask-paginate pytz`
  * Add the [mysql apt repository](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/repo/apt/) to your sources. You can use `dkpg -i` or just use Gnome Software Center to install it by double clicking it.
  * Update and install mysql-community-server:  
  `sudo apt update && sudo apt install mysql-community-server`
  * Check systemd to ensure the MySQL daemon is enabled and active:  
  `sudo systemctl status mysql ---- check that daemon is active and enabled`
  * Install the config will get the config you need for the last two pip modules:  
  `sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev` 
  * Install the last of the Python modules:  
  `pip3 install flask-mysqldb mysql-connector-python`
  * Install the mysql-connector:  
  `sudo apt install mysql-connector-python-py3`
  * Install MySQL shell:  
  `sudo apt install mysql-shell`
  * Go into mysql shell by executing this command: `mysql --user root -p` and then execute  
  `SET GLOBAL sql_mode=(SELECT REPLACE(@@sql_mode,'ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY',''));`

## 2. Setting up the Databases üìä
The Event data will be ingested into a MySQL database titled `crossRefEventDataMain`. The script to create it can be found [here](https://github.com/tdbowman-CompSci-F2020/openAlt/blob/master/SQL/CrossrefeventdataWithMain/crossrefeventdataWithMain.sql).  
  
The journal, publisher, author, title, and date information is stored in a seperate MySQL database titled `doidata`. The script to create it can be found [here](https://github.com/darpanshah-wsu/openAlt_W2021/blob/darpanDev/SQL/DOI_Author_Database/doidataSchema.sql).

Anyone can use our scripts and database schemas to create and fill in `crossRefEventDataMain`, but you will need to use other methods to fill in the needed fields for `doidata`. This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fabiobatalha/crossrefapi) is a good place to start.

The `OpenCitations` database can be created using the opencitationsSchema.sql that can be found [here](https://github.com/darpanshah-wsu/openAlt_W2021/blob/master/SQL/OpenCitations/opencitationsSchema.sql).

The 'BulkSearchStats' database is necessary for the bulk search limitation to avoid user abuse of the system. The schema to create this database can be found [here](https://github.com/darpanshah-wsu/openAlt_W2021/tree/master/SQL/BulkSearchStats).

## 3. Collecting and Ingesting the Events, Metadata, and Citations üè∑Ô∏è
Before we can run the web server, we also need to collect the data from the Crossref API. This will take some time, as there are millions of events to collect. We highly recommend reading Crossref's [guide](https://www.eventdata.crossref.org/guide/) before continuing.  

Our Python script `openAlt/pythonScripts/fetchEventBuffer.py` grabs new Event data from the Crossref API. This data is retrieved in a JSON format and then ingest into `crossrefeventdatamain` database.

Author metadata for publications are also retrieved from the Crossref API. Metada can be fetched and ingested by running the `metadataThroughMongoDB.py` script which can be found [here](https://github.com/darpanshah-wsu/openAlt_W2021/blob/master/pythonScripts/metadataThroughMongoDB.py).

Citation data is retrieved from the OpenCitations API. This takes a longer duration than fetching the event data as a publication can have upwards of thosands of citations. We also recommend the reading the manual for OpenCitations API [here](https://opencitations.net/index/coci/api/v1).

`openAlt/pythonScripts/fetchOpenCitations.py` script can be run to fetch citation data for all of the publications of doidata database and store them in OpenCitations database.

### 3.1 Example JSON Format:
Downloaded JSON files will look similar to this. Each of the 13 Event types has a unique format.  
```JSON

### 5. Quirks of the Crossref API ‚ùì
* Some Events give a DOI(objectID) of simply https://doi.org. For example, the event with ID: `5c83ca20-d4a1-471b-a23f-f21486cefb5c`
* Some DOI's in the Crossref Event data are malformed.  
This appears to be an inability of the Crossref agent to process Arabic text. We have only observed this for Twitter events so far.  
For example, the event with ID `5dd6719b-8981-4712-988c-8c01f7ad760b` has a DOI(objectID) of:  
 ```
 "obj_id": "https://doi.org/www.kau.edu.sa/content.aspx?pg=%d9%88%d8%b8%d8%a7%d8%a6%d9%81-%d8%b4%d8%a7%d8%ba%d8%b1%d8%a9-%d8%b9%d9%84%d9%89-%d8%a8%d9%86%d8%af-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a7%d8%ac%d9%88%d8%b1-%d8%a8%d9%88%d9%83%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a9-%d8%b4%d8%b7%d8%b1-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b7%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a8%d8%a7%d8%aa"
 ```
* Many Twitter Events do not provide a link to the tweet as their subjectID. Instead, they have only `http://twitter.com` as their link.  Since these events do not contain useful links, we have designed the website to hide these events from the "Latest Events" section on the article dashboard. These events are still counted towards the total number of events for the author/article.

## 6. How to run the web server üñ•Ô∏è

### 6.1 Before we Start ‚úã
This guide assumes you are using Python 3.8, and have established the `crossrefeventdatamain` and `doidata` databases in MySQL. Check `openAlt/SQL/` for the relevant scripts.  
If you have Python 2 installed, you will need to substitute Python3 for Python below.  

### 6.2 Step by Step Guide üìù
These actions should be performed inside the `openAlt/web/` folder.
1) Install virtualenv: `pip install virtualenv`.
2) Create a virtual environment: `python -m virtualenv venv`.
3) Activate the environment:
    - Windows: `./venv/scripts/activate`.
    - Linux/Mac: `./venv/bin/activate`.
4) Install Flask and our dependencies to this virtual environment:
    - `pip install flask mysql-connector-python flask-mysqldb python-dateutil flask-paginate`.
5) Create a new file named 'passwd.txt'.
    - Open the file and type only your MySQL user password.
    - Save and close.
    - This file is ignored by git but used by app.py to access your local MySQL server.
6) Navigate to config folder and locate `OpenAltConfig.json`. Change MySQL username and password to suit your device.
7) If you are not using the root MySQL user account, you will need to change the user on line 19 in `app.py`.
8) Start the web server using `python app.py`.
9) When the web server starts, navigate to [127.0.0.1:5000](127.0.0.1:5000).
