    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The goal of this project is to create a dashboard-style interface that displays activity and engagement surrounding scientific publications.  \n",
    "\n",
    "[Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/) is an official agency responsible for assigning DOIs (Document Object Identifier) to published papers. Their API provides a substantial amount of data, which is used to create dashboards such as Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus. Due to differences between platforms, h-index, i10-index, and citation counts vary depending on which site you use.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will work to create a web interface that organizes, simplifies, and visualizes this data. Our web interface will also rank authors in a consistent, and well documented way to facilitate bibliometric and altmetric research.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "Python Modules (These may be installed with `pip install <name of module>`\n",
    "* schedule\n",
    "* crossrefapi\n",
    "\n",
    "## Acknowledgements\n",
    "We would like to thank:  \n",
    "* Dr. Timothy Bowman for the project idea and guidance! ðŸ’¡  \n",
    "* Minh Nguyen for assisting us with technical questions ðŸ’¬ \n"
