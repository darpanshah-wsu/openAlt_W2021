# Building an Interface for Crossref Event Data

Hassan Bachir, Mitchell Fenner, Mohammad Riyadh, Ponnila Sampath Kumar, Dr. Timothy Bowman 
See the full documentation on the [Jupyter README](https://github.com/tdbowman-CompSci-F2020/crossrefEventData/blob/master/readme.ipynb).
## Overview
The goal of this project is to create a dashboard-style interface that displays activity and engagement surrounding scientific publications.  

[Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/) is an official agency responsible for assigning DOIs (Document Object Identifier) to published papers. Their API provides a substantial amount of data, which is used to create dashboards such as Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus. Due to differences between platforms, h-index, i10-index, and citation counts vary depending on which site you use.  

We will work to create a web interface that organizes, simplifies, and visualizes this data. Our web interface will also rank authors in a consistent, and well documented way to facilitate bibliometric and altmetric research.
